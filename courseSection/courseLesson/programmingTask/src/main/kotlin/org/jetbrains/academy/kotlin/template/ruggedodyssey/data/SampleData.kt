    The European Rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) has been officially reclassified as “Near Threatened” with
    extinction, in its native range, by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Many people
    remain unaware that the European Rabbit is native to just Spain, Portugal and small parts of North Africa,
    from where it was introduced elsewhere by humans (e.g. into the UK and Australia). Similarly, many do not
    know that rabbits have declined massively in the Iberian Peninsula in recent decades, and that this has had a
    huge impact on wider nature conservation given that rabbits are a vital prey species for many other animals.
